# whatsapp_data_analyzer
**This repository is a simple tool that lets the user analyze whatsapp chats and perform natural language processing tasks.**
The first step is to extract the chat data from Whatsapp. You can do this by going to the desired private/group chat, click on the three dots in the upper right corner, click on *more* and then *export chat*. You will be asked whether media files should be included in the extracted file. After doing all this steps, you will receive a *.txt* file that cointains all the messages in the chat.
